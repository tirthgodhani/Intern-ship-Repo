*<h2>28-29th May</h2>* *: Practicing State Management with Redux:*

*->* *State management is a critical aspect of building scalable and maintainable applications, and Redux is a popular library that helps manage and centralize application state in JavaScript applications. Practicing state management with Redux involves understanding its core concepts and applying them to manage the application's state predictably and efficiently.*

<li><b>Actions:</b> Plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state. Each action must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.</li> 
<li><b>Reducers:</b>  Pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.</li> 
<li><b>Store:</b>  A centralized place to store the application state. The store holds the state tree and provides methods to dispatch actions and subscribe to state changes.</li> 

*<h2>30-1st June</h2>* *: Exploring Tailwind CSS:*

*Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly build custom user interfaces by composing small, reusable utility classes directly in their HTML. This approach promotes consistency, efficiency, and maintainability in styling web applications.*

<li><b>Responsive Design:</b> Tailwind CSS includes built-in responsive design utilities, making it simple to create mobile-first designs. Developers can apply styles conditionally based on screen size using responsive prefixes.</li>
<li><b>Customization:</b> Tailwind is highly customizable. Developers can extend the default configuration to include custom colors, fonts, spacing, and other design tokens, making it possible to create a unique design system for each project.</li>
<li><b>Efficiency:</b> By using utility classes directly in the HTML, Tailwind reduces the need for writing custom CSS. This approach helps to avoid bloated CSS files and improves development efficiency.</li>
